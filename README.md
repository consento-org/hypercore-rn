# hypercore-rn
Running hypercore in React-Native

## How it works

- Uses our fork of sodium-javascript for crypto
- Provides some node.js style globals that are needed for stuff to work.
- Uses hyperswarm-proxy-ws for connecting to the p2p network
- Uses react-native specific storage? (in memory to start)
